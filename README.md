##Installation instructions

You'll need to have `Node.js` and `gulp` installed on your machine.
Then run :

```bash
npm install
```

That command will install all deps needed then run :

```bash
gulp dist
```

This will compile the project to the dist folder.

You can now access the website through `index.html` file.
